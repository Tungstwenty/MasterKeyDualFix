    <string name="about_description">This patch addresses a few vulnerability issues found on Android that are
collectively known as \'Master Key\' exploits:\n- \'bug 8219321\'
\n- \'bug 9695860\'
\n- \'bug 9950697\'
\n- and some additional corrections applied on Android 4.4
\n\nIn general terms, these allow <b>exploiting signed APKs</b> by replacing the code they contain while maintaining
the existing signature valid (hence the term \'Master Key\'), leading you to think the original author is someone you trust.\nThe original Android sources have been corrected to fix these problems, but it might take a while
till stock ROMs include the fixes, if ever.\n\nFor any questions, please visit <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2365294">this thread</a>.</string>
