    <string name="about_description">This patch addresses 2 vulnerability issues recently found on Android:\n- \'Master Key\'
\n- \'bug 9695860\'\nBoth of these allow <b>exploiting signed APKs</b> by replacing the code they contain while maintaining
the existing signature valid, leading you to think the original author is someone you trust.\nThe original Android sources have been corrected to fix both situations, but it might take a while
till stock ROMs include the fixes, if ever.\n\nFor any questions, please visit <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2365294">this thread</a>.</string>
